ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @XxZeroGravityxX

I'm interested in developing automation tools for solving various tasks, not limited to any area, 
but to learn new coding, visualization, mathematical and statistics methods and practices from/for them.
Also I'm interested in learning new techniques and approaches for Machine Learning and Deep Learning and 
their applications in the real world.

ðŸ‘€ I use mainly Python for any project and I'm currently developing data science projects and some
automation ones too.

I'm looking to cooperate in any of the fields above or a new one to learn new tools and topics.
